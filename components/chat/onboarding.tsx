Hereâ€™s how it works:  
- Weâ€™ll start with some basic info, like your therapy goals and current challenges.  
- Then, weâ€™ll reflect on insights from your last session to keep you on track.  

No pressureâ€”just share what feels comfortable. Let me know when youâ€™re ready, and weâ€™ll take it one step at a time. Youâ€™ve got this! ðŸ’›`;
