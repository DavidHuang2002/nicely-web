Here’s how it works:  
- We’ll start with some basic info, like your therapy goals and current challenges.  
- Then, we’ll reflect on insights from your last session to keep you on track.  

No pressure—just share what feels comfortable. Let me know when you’re ready, and we’ll take it one step at a time. You’ve got this! 💛`;
